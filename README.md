# find-dead-links
 
to install this program type

make install INSTALL_DIR=~/bin

// I am unsure what I did wrong with the naming of the python files
//for some reason the executable python file does not end in .py
//so the other file is labeled find-dead-link instead of find-dead-links since one should end with .py
// also only got to work with a link depth of 0
